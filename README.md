## Landscape
---
* Verifi’s main domain used is their primary product which is Cardholder Dispute Resolution Network (CDRN). This product helps connect financial organizations and merchants to act in real time to initiate traditional chargeback procedures, real time to issue refunds or to work to clear up equivocal transaction histories. 
* Over last 5 years chargebacks have escalated for merchants and issuers. Chargebacks were a $31 billion problem with $19 billon of the burden falling exclusively on merchants. 63% of consumers ceased merchant support after a dispute, which is not a defensible trend. This aspect has made it very stimulating for merchants to stay true to their route of success. 
* Verifi has quite a few immense rivals in their domain. Such companies that rival them revenue generate, data provided for merchants and companies, and staffing. To list a few which are:
Dun & Bradstreet,
Ethoca,
Accertify, and
Chargebacks 911

## Results
---
* Verfi’s vision has effectively help payments grow by creating new technologies that allow for merchants to have a better understanding of what is trendy in their business through an analytic base method and by adding up to 2,000 additional data points outside your standard customer information so Verifi could create more advanced solutions and then leverage a very adaptable decision engine to take action. 
* Today Verifi is branched into a number of directions. They have focused their concepts on risk. The tools they have built to increase the lifetime value of their customer relationships.

## Recommendations
---
* After studying customer habits I would recommend Verifi to create several omnichannels to help better serve their products to merchants. Customers who do online research of both competitors and merchant s spend 13% more than those online visiting in-store.  Companies who have four or more channels spent on average 9% more in-store, compared to customers who used only one channel. With such channels it will help better eliminate chargebacks, stolen merchandise, recourse and time costs, and brand reputation. These cannot be ignored especially around the holiday sale season. For merchants who have been burned with card fraud, these channels can help decline the dishonest customers
